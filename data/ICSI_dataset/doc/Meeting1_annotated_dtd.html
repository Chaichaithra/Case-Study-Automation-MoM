<p>The ".mrt" files contain both the transcript of the meeting and
certain meta data. This file describes the format. It includes
examples for most entries.

<p>Example: 

<p>&lt;Meeting Session="Bmr012" DateTimeStamp="2001-02-01-1500" Version="1" VersionDate="Dec 11 2002"&gt;

<p>The Session tag specifies the location (B for the ICSI meeting
room in Berkeley), the meeting type (mr for meeting recorder
meeting), and a unique 3 digit number. For a complete description of
naming conventions, please see naming.txt or naming.html in the doc
directory. 

<p>The DateTimeStamp is the start time and date of the meeting. The
format is yyyy-mm-dd-hhmm, where hh is a 24 hour time.

<p>The Version and VersionDate indicate the version of the
transcript.

&lt;!ELEMENT Preamble (Notes|Participants|Channels)*&gt;
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
<p>The Preamble contains meta data about the participants, the
channels, and free-form notes about the meeting.

<hr>
<pre>
&lt;!ELEMENT Notes    (#PCDATA)&gt;
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
<p>The Notes contain free-form notes. Often, it will contain information
about problems with the meeting (e.g. dead batteries), participant
information (e.g. mn017 left early), and tasks in the meeting
(e.g. simultaneous digits).

<p>The names of participants have been replaced with their speaker IDs in
the Notes section.

<hr>
<pre>
&lt;!ELEMENT Participants (Participant)*&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST Participants DB CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
<p>Information about the Participants of the meeting. By "Participant",
we simply mean any person who spoke during the meeting. The DB tag
indicates the speaker database in which is stored more information
about the participants.

<hr>
<pre>
&lt;!ELEMENT Participant EMPTY&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST Participant  Name ID  #REQUIRED
                       Channel IDREF #IMPLIED
                       Seat CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
<p>Examples:

<p>      &lt;Participant Name="me018" Channel="chan0" Seat="9"/&gt;<br>
      &lt;Participant Name="mn005" Channel="chanB"/&gt;<br>
      &lt;Participant Name="mn014"/&gt;<br>

<p>The Name is the unique user tag. See naming.txt or naming.html
in the doc directory for details on the naming convention, and the
speaker database (icsi1.spk) for additional information about each
speaker.

<p>The Channel is a unique tag indicating the primary near-field channel
on which the participant can be heard (see below). If the participant
did not use a near-field microphone, then the Channel tag will be
absent.

<p>The Seat indicates in which seat the participant started the
meeting. The seats are numbered clockwise starting at the door (see
seatingchart.txt in the doc directory). We only began recording seat
location about half way through the collection process, so many
meetings do not have Seat tags.

&lt;!ELEMENT Channels (Channel)*&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT Channel EMPTY&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST Channel Name ID #REQUIRED
                  Mic CDATA #IMPLIED
                  Transmission CDATA #IMPLIED
                  Gain CDATA #IMPLIED
                  AudioFile CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
<p>Example:

<p>      &lt;Channel Name="chan0" Mic="c1" Transmission="w1" Gain="9" AudioFile="chan0.sph"/&gt;<br>
      &lt;Channel Name="chanE" Mic="c2" Transmission="u1" Gain="9" AudioFile="chanE.sph"/&gt;

<p>The Channel contains information about the microphones. The
Name is a unique identifier for the channel. The Mic is an
identifier for the type of microphone (e.g. c1 is a Crown Headset
Microphone, c2 is a Crown PZM desktop microphone). Transmission
indicates how the microphone is connected to the recording system
(e.g. w1 is a wireless Sony system, j1 is a wired jack). See
naming.txt or naming.html for details.

<p>The Gain is a software recording level setting. Note that some early
meetings did not indicate the gain setting. In these cases, a default
gain (which is probably incorrect) is listed in this tag, and
mention is made in the Notes section.

<p>Finally, the AudioFile contains the file name in which the data is
stored. For the ICSI meeting corpus, the files are in NIST
Sphere/audio format and have been compressed with the "shorten"
program.

                  DigitTask (true | false) 'false'&gt;
</pre>
<hr>
<p> Example:

<p>    &lt;Segment StartTime="331.150" EndTime="332.339" Participant="me011"&gt;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;On &lt;Emphasis&gt; which &lt;/Emphasis&gt; tool?<br>
    &lt;/Segment&gt;

<p>Each Segment must identify a start time and an end time measured in
seconds from the start of the audio file. If the segment represents
sounds from a particular participant (e.g. speech), then the Segment
must include a Participant attribute. The value of the Participant
attribute must match the Name attribute from the Participant tag (see
above). The Channel defaults to the Channel specified in the
Participant tag. In unusual cases, the Channel may specify a channel
different from the default channel (e.g. a participant temporarily
uses another participant's microphone).

<p>If the participant spoke into a near-field microphone, then the
CloseMic attribute will be true (the default). Otherwise, the CloseMic
attribute will be false.

<p>During most meetings, we ask the participants to read a set of
connected digits. The DigitTask attribute should be true during these
segments.

<p>Note on acronyms: We did not include a separate acronym
tag. Instead, if the acronym is pronounced as a word, then the acronym
is listed with no special notation. For example, NASA will simply
appear as "NASA".

<p>If the letters of the acronym are spoken, such as with "IBM", this
is denoted by underscores in the transcription. For example, "IBM"
appears in the corpus as "I_B_M".

<p>Mixed cases also appear. For example, "x ray" is transcribed
"X_ray".

<p>See the section on &lt;Emphasis&gt; below for important information
on acronyms with emphasis.

<p>Example:
<p>&lt;Foreign Language="de"&gt; Nein. &lt;/Foreign&gt;

<p>Parts of a segment that are spoken in a language other than English
are identified with the Foreign tag. The attribute Language is
required, and must be the two letter international language symbol for
the language being used.

<ul>
<li>de - German
<li>it - Italian
<li>no - Norwegian
<li>fr - French
<li>es - Spanish
<li>la - Latin

<p>The Description attribute is optional, but frequently contains the
translation.

<p>
<p>
<p>When a syllable in a word is emphasized, the word may be marked with
the Emphasis tag. 

<p>When Emphasis is used within an acronym, the coding is a
combination of underscores and the Emphasis tags. For example,
"I_&lt;Emphasis&gt; B &lt;/Emphasis&gt;_M" indicates that the B is
emphasized.

<p>When the emphasis tag is in the leading position, it may indicate that
any syllable is emphasized. For example:

<p>I_&lt;Emphasis&gt; B &lt;/Emphasis&gt;_M &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The B is emphasized<br>
&lt;Emphasis&gt; I_B_M &lt;/Emphasis&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any syllable may be emphasized

and &lt;Pronounce&gt; partially  &lt;/Pronounce&gt;

<p>When an obviously non-canonical pronunciation is used, it may be
marked with the Pronounce tag. The Pronunciation attribute, if
included, indicates how the word or phrase was actually pronounced,
either by specifying the pronunciation (as in the first example) or by
describing its properties (as in the second example). The contained
text shows the canonical pronunciation. If the Pronunciation attribute is
missing, it indicates that the word was pronounced in a non-canonical
way.

<p>In cases where the transcriber was uncertain of the transcript, the
Uncertain tag may be used. The contained text is the transcriber's best
guess, or may be the special symbol @@ to mean unintelligible. If the
NumSyllables attribute is given, it is the transcriber's best guess at
the number of syllables in the Uncertain section.
