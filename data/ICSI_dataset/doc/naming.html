<h1>Meeting Recorder Naming Conventions</h1>

<P>The goal of the naming conventions is to have consistent, short,
and easy to use names for people, microphones, channels, etc. Each
field is fixed length, so sorting and listing is easy. Finally, the
convention is easily extended so that we or others can add data to the
corpus.</P>

<ul>
<li><a href="#mid">Meeting IDs</a></li>
<li><a href="#speakerid">Speaker IDs</a></li>
<li><a href="#micid">Microphone IDs</a></li>
<li><a href="#transid">Transmission IDs</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="mid"></a>Meeting IDs</h3>

<P>An individual meeting (also called a session) is labeled with an
alphanumeric tag. For example, <em>"Bmr002"</em>. The tag consists of
three fields. The first field must be alphabetic and all uppercase,
and should be one letter. It represents the location of the recording.
We reserve "B" for recordings at ICSI (Berkeley).</P>

<P>The second field must be alphabetic and all lowercase, and should
have two letters. It represents the meeting type. The following tags
are currently assigned:</P>

<table border>
<tr><th>Tag</th><th>Meeting Type</th></tr>
<tr><td>db</td><td>Database issues meeting</td></tr>
<tr><td>ed</td><td>Even Deeper Understanding weekly meeting</td></tr>
<tr><td>mr</td><td>Meeting Recorder weekly meeting</td></tr>
<tr><td>ns</td><td>Network Services and Applications group meeting</td></tr>
<tr><td>ro</td><td>Robustness weekly meeting</td></tr>
<tr><td>sr</td><td>SRI collaboration meeting</td></tr>
<tr><td>tr</td><td>Meeting Recorder transcriber's meeting</td></tr>
<tr><td>uw</td><td>UW collaboration meeting</td></tr>
</table>

<P>The final field must be numeric, consisting of three digits
(e.g. "004").</P>

<h3><a name="speakerid"></a>Speaker IDs</h3>

<P>Speaker tags consist of "m", "f", "u", or "x", for male, female,
unknown, and computer-generated respectively, followed by "e"
for native English speaker or "n" for non-native English speaker,
followed by three numbers. The numbers should be unique across all
speakers (e.g. there is only one person with a speaker ID ending in
003). For example, "fn002" and "me005" are both legal speaker IDs.</P>

<p>We have developed an XML database (icsi1.spk in the doc
directory) containing speaker information, education level,
language, age, etc. For details on the information we collect,
see the comments in icsi1.spk and the online speaker form:

<h3><a name="micid"></a>Mic IDs</h3>
<P>A microphone ID represents the type of microphone. It is separate
from the <a href="#transid">transmission ID</a>, which represents the method
by which the signal gets to the recording equipment. A microphone ID
consists of a letter and a number. The microphone IDs used at ICSI
are:</P>

<table border>
<tr><th>Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>s1</td><td>Sony headset mic ECM-310BMP</td></tr>
<tr><td>s2</td><td>Sony handheld mic WRT-807A</td></tr>
<tr><td>c1</td><td>Crown headset mic CM 311 A/E</td></tr>
<tr><td>l1</td><td>Sony lapel (lavalier) ECM-77BMP</td></tr>
<tr><td>p1</td><td>Plantronics monaural headset mic (part number unknown)</td></tr>
<tr><td>a1</td><td>Andrea monaural headset mic NC-50</td></tr>
<tr><td>u1</td><td>Unknown monaural headset mic</td></tr>
<tr><td>u2</td><td>Unknown earplug mic</td></tr>
<tr><td>c2</td><td>Crown PZM desktop microphone</td></tr>
<tr><td>u3</td><td>Unknown microphone in mockup PDA</td></tr>
</table>

<h3><a name="transid"></a>Transmission IDs</h3>
<P>The transmission ID represents the method by which the microphone
is connected to the recording equipment. It is a letter followed by a
number. The transmission IDs used at ICSI are:</P>
<table border>
<tr><th>Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>j1</td><td>Wired jack (via jimlet through jimbox)</td></tr>
<tr><td>w1</td><td>Wireless Sony transmitter/receivers (Sony MB-806A
modular base, WRU-806A/64 UHF synthesized tuner modules, WRT-805A
bodypack transmitter)</td></tr>
<tr><td>w2</td><td>Wireless Sony transmitter/receiver integrated into
unit (e.g. Sony handset with integrated transmitter)</td></tr>
<tr><td>u1</td><td>Unknown wired type (e.g. PZMs)</td></tr>
</table>
