*PVI:	because they show underwear ? 175650_176980
*NIT:	yeah, I mean, xxx there are a lot of ads that take this sort of

*PVI:	hm . 177500_177880
*FDH:	mhm . 181350_181860

*NIT:	xxx +//. 187290_188160
*NIT:	hard to say . 191960_206550
*NIT:	I [/?] uhm@fp actually I was hearing on the radio the other day . 191960_206550
*NIT:	about [/?] uhm@fp &=breath they [?] were talking specifically about

	uh@fp (.) sexual images and [/?] and even misogynistic images these
	days . 191960_206550
*PVI:	yeah, this doesn't look American to me . 206430_210510
*PVI:	I would have guessed French, probably . 206430_210510
*NIT:	yeah, definitely not . 208140_209470
*FDH:	uhm@fp (.) yeah . 212390_218680
*FDH:	I have another page of French ads, (.) but it is not gonna work, is
	it . 212390_218680
*FDH:	&=smack &=breath go back over here . 212390_218680
*NIT:	&=breath yeah, apparently <there is a new movement (.) to> [/?]
	uh@fp (.) <a new> [/?] there is a new uh@fp I guess it is a feminist
	movement . 220540_232400
*NIT:	to [/?] &=breath to [/?] uh@fp they're fighting for a legislation
	to block some of the [/?] &=breath the sexist ads . 220540_232400
*FDH:	hm ? 224560_225050
*PVI:	&=smack in America or in France ? 232310_234130
*NIT:	no, this is in France . 233050_234330
*PVI:	okay . 234130_234650
*FDH:	uh@fp &=breath yeah, the [/?] I think hes@fp it was the EU . 234540_292630
*FDH:	<at le@i> [/-] i@i [/-] so@i [/?] some organization in Norway was
	uh@fp fighting against &=breath using uhm@fp feminine [/?] female
	images in advertising . 234540_292630
*FDH:	&=breath and uh@fp &=breath they were trying to block exactly (.)
	like what they're doing in France . 234540_292630
*FDH:	&=breath but this was in nineteen ninety eight, and what I found
	interesting is that they've been trying to do it in America for (.)
	dozen years, at least, if not longer . 234540_292630
*FDH:	&=breath uhm@fp &=breath this is another &=breath observation that
	I made with the French advertising . 234540_292630
*FDH:	and I've [?] gone through so many French magazines that I got [?],
	and I've gathered more French ads than any other (.) ads from any
	other country . 234540_292630
*FDH:	&=breath uhm@fp and this is one of the motifs . 234540_292630
*FDH:	this isn't all the ads I've found but &=breath two of these ads I
	found in the same magazine, where the woman is clutching her
	&=breath breast . 234540_292630
*FDH:	and I found that &=breath &=breath it was kind of striking to find
	that . 234540_292630
*FDH:	and it was all perfumes that are being advertised . 234540_292630
*FDH:	&=smack I think it is a cultural thing, but I'm not really sure . 234540_292630
*FDH:	&=breath (.) so I [?] would open that up and &=breath see what you
	guys have to say about it . 234540_292630
*PVI:	hm@fp the middle one is different than the other two . 297400_318250
*PVI:	&=breath I've heard that some people find the middle one
	particularly obscene, where [?] I don't really see that . 297400_318250
*PVI:	&=breath I don't find it much worse or better than &=breath many of
	the other ads . 297400_318250
*PVI:	hes@fp displaying nudity . 297400_318250
*PVI:	actually, I probably find it less insulting than the other two, I
	think . 297400_318250
*FDH:	uh+huh . 312590_313150
*FDH:	why ? 318480_319110
*PVI:	uhm@fp &=breath &=swallow &=breath it looks more like &=breath art
	or like a painting (.) than the other two . 319340_336170
*PVI:	<it is not> [/-] (.) I don't know . 319340_336170
*PVI:	I can't really say, but it looks more esthetic to me . 319340_336170
*FDH:	uh+huh . 325380_325830
*FDH:	would you think that these are American ads, or ? 339250_341630
*NIT:	no, I would not, <I would be> [/?] &=breath hes@fp I would be
	surprised xxx to see these ads in an American magazine . 341710_348770
*FDH:	mhm . 348740_349330
*NIT:	uhm@fp (.) at least, you know (.) in [/?] in non+pornographic
	American magazine . 349380_355390
*FDH:	uhm@fp &=smack &=breath just a note on [/?] on this ad, the
	Givenchy ad . 356790_376440
*FDH:	&=breath (.) the [?] ad is from a French magazine but I found the
	same ad in Pittsburgh . 356790_376440
*FDH:	uh@fp it was a cardboard cutout in a Kaufmann's store . 356790_376440
*FDH:	&=breath but she wasn't clutching her breast and her breast wasn't
	bare . 356790_376440
*FDH:	the dress sleeve was up here and her arm was behind her back . 356790_376440
*FDH:	she was standing like this . 356790_376440
*PVI:	&=laugh . 372710_373480
*PVI:	huh . 376990_378390
*PVI:	that is funny . 376990_378390
*NIT:	w@i [/?] was it the same picture in other respects, just had been
	(.) like reworked ? 377120_381350
*FDH:	everything else was identical . 378980_380780
*FDH:	yup . 381400_381900
*NIT:	huh . 382100_382560
*PVI:	interesting . 382820_383600
*FDH:	what do you guys thing about that ? 384080_385060
*NIT:	well, they [/?] uh@fp &=breath I guess the advertisers know the
	uh@fp standards of the people they're marketing to . 386070_392330
*PVI:	it goes in with &=smack Americans cutting scenes out of movies that
	have too much sex . 393320_400850
*PVI:	and, so . 393320_400850
*FDH:	but I found the same thing in New_York and it was this one . 401480_404100
*FDH:	&=breath . 401480_404100
*PVI:	wow . 404520_405200
*NIT:	well, New_York is not America . 405330_406800
*FDH:	&=laugh why do you say that ? 407480_409230
*NIT:	well, I mean, yeah . 408750_428000
*NIT:	<it is &=breath uhm@fp &=breath I guess> [/-] uh@fp the Russians
	actually have <a sayin@i> [/?] a saying, uhm@fp (.) Moscow is not
	Russia . 408750_428000
*NIT:	and I mean, it is the capital, but it is not, you know, New_York is
	like our (.) biggest, you know, and (.) brightest city but it [?] is
	not &=breath really &=breath uh@fp representative of what goes on
	elsewhere in the country . 408750_428000
*PVI:	I don't know . 408990_409760
*FDH:	uh+huh . 420930_421520
*FDH:	hm@fp okay . 428300_428970
*PVI:	you think they're more tolerant xxx +//. 428890_430810
*NIT:	well, I think they're more cosmopolitan . 430750_432460
*PVI:	hm . 432560_433130
*NIT:	I mean, almost by necessity . 433400_434970
*PVI:	I don't know . 436250_437110
*FDH:	uh@fp I'm gonna talk about this ad again in a minute, and tell you
	a little about the controversy that it did stir, what kind of
	brought up . 438510_444170
*FDH:	all right . 448470_474740
*FDH:	well, I guess this goes back to what you said earlier about
	American use of nudity, and one of the things I found . 448470_474740
*FDH:	&=breath there is another ad, it is on the next slide, but it is a
	two page ad, it didn't fit, so I'll show it in a minute . 448470_474740
*FDH:	&=breath &=smack uhm@fp (.) I [?] found that American
	advertisements' use of nudity is really &=breath &=swallow
	provocative in a way that it is trying to create a sexual innuendo,
	but it is very blatant . 448470_474740
*FDH:	(.) uhm@fp it is not really artistically done, the way the French
	ads are done . 448470_474740
*NIT:	could say that . 475340_476150
*FDH:	uhm@fp so, &=breath I also found a lot of American ads cut the head
	out of the females . 477230_507370
*FDH:	&=breath uhm@fp the other ad on the next slide, I'll show it in a
	second, &=breath uhm@fp is the same thing, and I found several ads
	where <the female> [/-] it is just here to here, and <that is> [/?]
	that is all you see . 477230_507370
*FDH:	&=breath whether it is covered or not, here to here . 477230_507370
*FDH:	that is it . 477230_507370
*FDH:	&=breath so, it is almost like saying her face isn't (.) important
	to what they're trying to display . 477230_507370
*FDH:	&=breath uhm@fp what I found is, like, with this ad, these [/?]
	these are from the same magazine . 477230_507370
*FDH:	&=breath uh@fp . 477230_507370
*NIT:	can I ask what magazine ? 506620_508110
*FDH:	m@i [/-] &=smack think it was FHM . 507980_510950
*PVI:	what is that ? 510930_511630
*NIT:	what is that ? 511560_512230
*FDH:	it is one of those silly uhm@fp (.) young men's magazines . 511720_515720
*NIT:	like GQ or Esquire ? 515070_517250
*FDH:	not [/?] not [/?] hes@fp actually not as nice as GQ, maybe like
	Details . 516550_519840
*NIT:	&=smack oh, yeah, Deta@i [/-] okay . 520030_521260
*FDH:	like, you go into Borders and you always see them <on the> [/?] on
	the wall and they're all the same and they always have some scantily
	clad girl . 520840_527790
*FDH:	&=breath like Maxim . 520840_527790
*NIT:	mhm . 528110_528650
*FDH:	uhm@fp but I got the magazines from my friend's [/?] (.) friend's

*FDH:	uh@fp Vogue is really more stylish . 546500_550750
*FDH:	&=breath <it is> [/?] it is like a Cosmo or a Glamour, maybe . 546500_550750
*PVI:	mhm . 550250_550800
*NIT:	it is like a lifestyle magazine . 550680_555310

	550680_555310
*NIT:	and +//. 550680_555310

*FDH:	&=breath and they have ads like this . 555920_567560

*NIT:	yeah . 559400_559870
*NIT:	oh, <I know> [/-] <the f@i> [/?] the first set of French lingerie

*FDH:	yeah . 581450_605650
*FDH:	<I think> [/?] (.) well hes@fp <I m@i> [/?] I think in that i@i
	[/-] w@i [/-] it is uhm@fp (.) &=breath unique in the way that they
	were running the campaign, that they were focusing just on the
	underwear, and that is all they were showing was the underwear . 581450_605650
*FDH:	&=smack &=breath uhm@fp but I found things like this &=breath in
