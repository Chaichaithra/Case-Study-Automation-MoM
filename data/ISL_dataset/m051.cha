*QXE:	okay . 11140_26740
*QXE:	so, last time, what we started to do, &=breath is uhm@fp wh@i [/-]
	oh, also of [/?] of course we [/?] <we break> [/?] we broke the

	uhm@fp <it was> [/?] uhm@fp there was a hole inside . 11140_26740

*QXE:	&=laugh that is your new word, joker ? 28440_49100
*QXE:	okay [?] . 28440_49100
*QXE:	&=breath so, last time we [/?] we uh@fp break &=smack some little

*QXE:	<we put the egg> [/?] we [/?] basically we tried to do a shell of

*QXE:	&=breath put it in that . 28440_49100
*QXE:	also pieces of that . 28440_49100

*MTY:	<let me> [/?] let me uh@fp +//. 49370_50400
*LQO:	uh@fp why don't we blow this up and this can be the bottom cushion
	? 50200_52350
*MTY:	well, what I was gonna (.) suggest is if we have a container like
	this and we somehow suspend the egg in the middle &=breath put it in
	the balloon . 51910_65800
*MTY:	&=breath we can attach this (.) to the top here and it can be
	totally suspended . 51910_65800
*LQO:	yeah, but you're assuming that it is gonna fall this way . 65770_67690
*QXE:	well, you can also halve [?] the balloon . 67890_70070
*MTY:	<I don't> [/-] yeah, I mean, I'm assuming it is gonna fall straight
	up and down . 68390_79140
*MTY:	I mean, &=breath <it might not> [/-] we could weight the bottom
	with [/?] with tape &=breath <to make it fal@i> [/?] to seduce [?]
	it to fall a certain way . 68390_79140
*MTY:	if we have enough tape . 68390_79140
*QXE:	you [/?] you can make a hole there . 71190_73050
*QXE:	yeah . 74820_75280
*QXE:	we can use that also to [/?] hm@fp to weight it . 77270_79470
*LQO:	I guess so . 79610_82520
*LQO:	&=breath but look . 79610_82520
*LQO:	<but the other thing we could do is> [/-] okay, hold on . 79610_82520
*MTY:	so, <let us here> [/?] let us hear (.) uh@fp or . 82160_85300
*QXE:	so, one idea was (.) you can blow the balloon, we can attach the
	balloon to the string (.) <make a> [/?] (.) make a hole there to xxx
	+//. 82570_92400
*SCG:	hm@fp yes . 86770_87390
*LQO:	right . 91650_95650
*LQO:	oh, and that would keep it upright . 91650_95650
*LQO:	(.) but the problem is then we wouldn't have this to hang it on . 91650_95650
*MTY:	up . 93360_94570
*MTY:	hm@fp yeah . 93360_94570
*QXE:	and in case we will gain <one meter> [/?] well, (.) fifty
	centimeter &=laugh to drop it . 94210_99220
*MTY:	yeah . 95700_97170
*MTY:	we would have no uh@fp +//. 95700_97170
*LQO:	right . 99140_108050
*LQO:	&=breath okay . 99140_108050
*LQO:	&=breath so, hes@fp h@i [/?] here is another plan . 99140_108050
*LQO:	so, what if we were to inflate this to some volume that would be
	okay &=breath and we were to basically put it in the bottom of this
	and then we put the egg (.) in +//. 99140_108050
*QXE:	on top ? 107610_108340
*LQO:	yeah . 108290_112050
*LQO:	&=breath and then basically that [/?] that would break the fall . 108290_112050
*LQO:	(.) probably . 108290_112050
*LQO:	like a@i +//. 108290_112050
*QXE:	no, there was one thing . 111990_120040
*QXE:	<we tried something> [/-] the thing is that &=breath (.) when it

*SCG:	okay . 120320_120950
*MTY:	well, <it is> [/?] <it is not gonna> [/-] it is hardboiled . 120770_126610
*MTY:	so, when it goes from here to here &=breath it is not gonna +//. 120770_126610
*QXE:	yeah . 125200_126030
*QXE:	it is +//. 125200_126030
*LQO:	<but I> [/?] I [/-] okay, so let us think about this . 126750_135670
*LQO:	so, i@i [/?] i@i [/?] if [/?] if we inflate this <to some> [/?] to
	some volume and then we try to put [/?] &=breath press the egg into
	the middle, (.) you know, like [/?] like this . 126750_135670
*LQO:	s@i +//. 126750_135670
*QXE:	you [/?] you think we can put the egg inside ? 134130_136280
*LQO:	no, I don't wanna put the egg inside . 136370_138910
*LQO:	but I wanna put it like this . 136370_138910
*LQO:	hes@fp . 136370_138910
*QXE:	oh, to do a cushion ? 137900_139110
*LQO:	yeah, from all sides . 139010_143300
*LQO:	(.) what do you think ? 139010_143300
*LQO:	do you think this is flexible enough or it is gonna break ? 139010_143300
*SCG:	I would suggest hes@fp to use hes@fp the balloon as a kind of
	parachute . 144300_171240
*SCG:	because &=breath if you don't, it [/?] it will fall very &=breath
	very fast . 144300_171240
*SCG:	and (.) okay . 144300_171240
*SCG:	<we can> [/?] we can try to use this as a shell . 144300_171240
*SCG:	but [/?] yes, &=breath but maybe (.) yes . 144300_171240
*SCG:	<and to> [/-] maybe [/?] maybe (.) this [/?] (.) this way . 144300_171240
*SCG:	so (.) this could be a [/?] a buffer . 144300_171240
*SCG:	a second buffer . 144300_171240
*SCG:	and (.) <we c@i> [/?] we could (.) hes@fp +//. 144300_171240
*QXE:	oh, on the top . 150880_152120
*QXE:	like +//. 150880_152120
*QXE:	like this ? 155790_156440
*QXE:	but then [/?] hes@fp then you have to +//. 161490_163150
*MTY:	well, <how much> [/?] how much buoyancy can this provide ? 161580_164260
*LQO:	yeah, I like this idea, actually . 169610_172600
*LQO:	<this is> [/?] this is okay . 169610_172600
*LQO:	(.) yeah . 169610_172600
*QXE:	and you put the egg there ? 170670_171930
*SCG:	yes, and <the balloon> [/?] (.) the balloon works as a kind of
	parachute and &=breath this is hes@fp the buffer when it d@i [/?]
	drops . 171810_186770
*SCG:	&=breath and ma@i [/?] <maybe it> [/-] it [/?] it [/-] yes . 171810_186770

*QXE:	so, hes@fp &=breath we can make little [/?] uh@fp little stuff . 182620_186400

*QXE:	oh, xxx be careful . 187010_188100
*SCG:	that way . 187950_188660
*QXE:	yeah, I like that . 188820_189750
*MTY:	so, <what do w@i> [/?] what do we have to do to do that ? 189580_191950
*MTY:	we have to like +//. 189580_191950

*LQO:	right . 203710_204720
*LQO:	yeah, but we can do it by hand . 205150_207020
*LQO:	we can do it by hand . 205150_207020
*QXE:	well, we can make holes with this . 205200_207450

*QXE:	do you want to attach it from here ? 224210_225990
*SCG:	because it is quite [/?] quite heavy . 224250_225930
