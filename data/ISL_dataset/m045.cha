*VIC:	&=breath which is all part of my thesis, which will be presented
	&=breath in [/?] some time in August or September . 5060_48620
*VIC:	&=breath so, &=breath just to say that hes@fp I kinda know what I'm
	talking about . 5060_48620
*VIC:	&=laugh <but I haven't r@i> [/-] like this is all the material I've
	been studying for the past two years . 5060_48620
*VIC:	<so &=breath some things> [/-] I [/?] I didn't practice for this or
	anything, let us just say . 5060_48620
*VIC:	&=breath so, when I do the thesis, it'll be much better than this .
	5060_48620
*VIC:	but, &=breath <I just> [/-] <there is> [/?] there is one specific
	idea <I wanna> [/?] I wanna throw out &=breath in the hopes that
	&=breath you guys can tell me if it is really good or (.) if it just
	doesn't make any sense whatsoever . 5060_48620
*VIC:	&=smack &=breath so, &=swallow but please stop me at any time
	because I don't wanna be the only one talking 'cause then that would
	be bad because &=breath we're recording this, so . 5060_48620
*NIL:	mhm . 25860_26460
*NIL:	oh . 47120_47590
*NIL:	so [/?] so, y@i [/?] you [/?] you're gonna give a presentation
	about something like art and we're going to ask questions ? 48320_53980
*LAU:	so +//. 48840_49340
*VIC:	yes . 54290_67160
*VIC:	s@i [/-] ask questions whenever you want . 54290_67160
*VIC:	&=breath <I'm not> [/?] I'm not really presenting something, I'm
	just (.) &=breath giving some information . 54290_67160
*VIC:	and then I want you guys to sort of (.) tell me what you think
	about it . 54290_67160
*VIC:	so, hes@fp <I'm not> [/-] it is not a lecture or a presentation
	&=breath per se . 54290_67160
*NIL:	oh . 54890_55460
*NIL:	good . 56460_57120
*NIL:	mhm . 59140_59730
*NIL:	it is a seminar . 66250_68090
*NIL:	(.) a +//. 66250_68090
*VIC:	yes, let us put it that way . 67750_69270
*NIL:	a uh@fp &=breath symposium . 68820_71410
*LAU:	&=laugh an interactive symposium . 71670_74880
*VIC:	well uh@fp &=breath +//. 72280_72920
*VIC:	yes, very interactive . 74200_76580
*VIC:	as interactive as possible . 74200_76580
*NIL:	well, t@i [/?] t@i [/?] technically speaking symposium means
	sitting around drinking, so . 75470_79580
*NIL:	uh@fp . 75470_79580
*LAU:	&=laugh . 75530_76710
*LAU:	does it really ? 79440_80300
*NIL:	a@i [/?] uh@fp according to the philosophy department here . 80340_82090
*MBE:	&=laugh . 82450_83570
*DAN:	hm . 82580_82980
*LAU:	oh . 82930_85340
*LAU:	&=laugh . 82930_85340
*NIL:	&=smack hm@fp they used to have wine at their symposia but they
	don't anymore . 84740_87150
*LAU:	oh . 86290_87790
*LAU:	well, that is nice . 86290_87790
*DAN:	&=throat . 87400_87950
*VIC:	&=swallow does anyone know who this is ? 88020_89410
*LAU:	well, it looks like Dennis Tito . 89200_90810
*MBE:	I thought it was Michael Fou@i [/?] Foucault . 91400_94100
*MBE:	&=laugh . 91400_94100
*VIC:	oh, it is not . 91480_92540
*NIL:	Foucault . 93430_94430
*LAU:	&=laugh . 93610_94570
*DAN:	&=laugh . 93650_94350
*VIC:	Foucault . 94390_95190
*MBE:	Foucault . 94480_95100
*NIL:	n@i [/?] no, I don't . 95920_96680
*VIC:	nah . 96540_163570
*VIC:	hm@fp Foucault is a French philosopher . 96540_163570
*VIC:	&=breath uh@fp he died in the nineteen eighties, so he [/?] he is
	very modern . 96540_163570
*VIC:	&=breath uh@fp and he wrote The_History_of_Sexuality &=breath along
	with some other uh@fp books . 96540_163570
*VIC:	&=breath and, basically his ideas are that &=breath you can take
	&=breath (.) what Christians and the Catholic_Church believe today
	with [/?] uhm@fp in terms of sexuality and that what they believe
	today is very new, &=breath and that a couple hundred years ago, no
	one really believed that stuff . 96540_163570
*VIC:	&=breath and, he &=breath has this three series volume, which I've
	read most of . 96540_163570
*VIC:	&=breath and uh@fp &=breath well, I'll take you to the next slide .
	96540_163570
*VIC:	&=breath I think . 96540_163570
*VIC:	okay . 96540_163570
*VIC:	&=smack &=breath his idea is based on genealogy . 96540_163570
*VIC:	so, &=smack if you say that this is sort of like a family tree,
	&=smack &=breath <he kinda of inc@i> [/?] he [/?] well, he
	incorporates the idea of genealogy &=breath to thought . 96540_163570
*VIC:	&=breath so, if you say that this is like a great great grand (.)
	person, and this is all their children, &=breath and, you know,
	they're bringing children in and they're mixing things together . 96540_163570
*VIC:	&=breath he applies this idea to thinking . 96540_163570
*VIC:	&=breath so, if we today think one of four things, &=breath we can
	trace it back in time to separate influences, &=breath to an
	original (.) idea . 96540_163570
*NIL:	hm . 105270_105660
*NIL:	mhm . 119380_119980
*NIL:	yes . 121880_122390
*NIL:	mhm . 143690_144300
*NIL:	mhm . 162780_167910
*NIL:	(.) hes@fp this is sort of like the (.) proto+science of
	pneumatics, then . 162780_167910
*VIC:	don't know what that is . 168340_169480
*LAU:	that what ? 168700_169970
*LAU:	&=laugh . 168700_169970
*NIL:	oh, uh@fp hes@fp I [/?] I'm [/-] this is very exciting because the
	[/?] th@i [/-] people have been wishing that someone cr@i [/?] would
	create a [/?] a science of [/?] of uh@fp ideas . 169590_177300
*VIC:	&=smack yeah . 177380_193940
*VIC:	&=smack Foucault i@i [/?] is sort of like <the f@i> [/?] the father
	of this genealogy idea which has been &=breath incorporated into
	other ideas . 177380_193940
*VIC:	there is another guy, whose named I can't remember, &=breath who
	has the idea which &=breath you can take thinking as if it is a gene
	and then you take lots of different genes and &=breath sometimes
	they mutate and you get new thinking involved . 177380_193940
*NIL:	good . 178290_178840
*NIL:	mhm . 181150_181740
*NIL:	&=smack yeah . 189480_190080
*NIL:	mhm . 193750_194290
*VIC:	uhm@fp (.) so, Foucault has &=breath all of our modern thinking and
	h@i [/?] he only really talks about religion and [/?] and sexuality
	. 194420_204340
*VIC:	&=breath uhm@fp &=smack it goes all the way back to ancient times .
	194420_204340
*LAU:	so, each of these boxes is like religion or sexuality or ? 203760_207240
*VIC:	<so each o@i> [/-] so, let us say today <we think of> [/-] a lot of
	people think of homosexuality as something bad . 206220_227240
*VIC:	&=breath but, in ancient times, it was something good . 206220_227240
*VIC:	&=breath so, if you think of something good &=breath and then this
	person &=breath has this idea on it &=breath and this other person
	has this idea on it . 206220_227240
*VIC:	&=breath and they each are influenced by something different
	throughout time . 206220_227240
*VIC:	&=breath throughout all the centuries, &=breath 'till we get to
	this idea here . 206220_227240
*VIC:	o@i +//. 206220_227240
*LAU:	oh . 211010_211540
*LAU:	uh+huh . 223830_224250
*NIL:	yeah . 226920_227460
*VIC:	but, I don't even know how to go back now . 227820_229470
*NIL:	understood . 228290_228940
*NIL:	I [/?] I see a [/?] a tool^box with an arrow button . 229770_232770
*VIC:	I don't know . 231820_232610
*VIC:	yeah . 234570_235100
*NIL:	oh . 234860_235340
*VIC:	no . 235910_237230
*VIC:	that is the whole show . 235910_237230
*NIL:	I shouldn't have mentioned it . 236870_240450
*NIL:	oh . 236870_240450
*NIL:	well, shouldn't have mentioned it . 236870_240450
*NIL:	&=laugh . 236870_240450
*VIC:	oh, let us just do it this way . 240240_255790
*VIC:	&=breath uhm@fp &=laugh yeah . 240240_255790
*VIC:	so, i@i [/?] hes@fp in ancient times, homosexuality was something
	everyone did, right ? 240240_255790
*VIC:	&=breath and then today, not everyone does this . 240240_255790
*VIC:	everyone has different ideas on it . 240240_255790
*VIC:	&=breath so, he is saying that you can take it from here and [/?]
	and go through . 240240_255790
*LAU:	&=laugh . 241250_242960
*NIL:	good . 241370_241770
*NIL:	mhm . 251110_251680
*LAU:	so, each of these boxes represents what one person thinks about
	something . 255750_259140
*VIC:	not just a person, but &=breath <it is> [/?] it is an idea . 258920_261570
*LAU:	one hes@fp school of thought about something . 260190_262580
*VIC:	right, right . 262030_292470
*VIC:	&=breath so, hes@fp it is always influenced . 262030_292470
*VIC:	so, wh@i [/-] &=breath <in this> [/?] <this is not i@i> [/?] this
	[?] is [?] just [?] an example to show what a (.) g@i [/?] genealogy
	tree would look like . 262030_292470
*VIC:	&=breath uhm@fp but if you say this is sexuality [/?] <or
	homosexuali@i> [/?] or, let us just say sexuality &=breath and sex
	is good . 262030_292470
*VIC:	&=breath but then you have i@i [/?] in German, hes@fp in German,
	<in Gr@i> [/?] in ancient Greece, &=breath the Stoics believed that
	&=breath (.) sex was bad . 262030_292470
*VIC:	&=breath so, there is even one extreme part of Stoicism that said
	&=breath you should not have sex at all . 262030_292470
*VIC:	not even procreation . 262030_292470
*VIC:	&=breath but then there is other people over here . 262030_292470
*NIL:	school of thought, good term . 262690_263990
*NIL:	mhm . 270090_270610
*NIL:	yeah . 275920_276270
*MBE:	but they died out . 291370_296320
*MBE:	&=laugh . 291370_296320
*NIL:	&=laugh yes . 292520_293370
*LAU:	&=laugh . 292910_293660
*VIC:	that they did . 293390_313440
*VIC:	&=breath uhm@fp &=breath or even the Shakers, you could say it was
	the Shakers . 293390_313440
*VIC:	they had the same idea . 293390_313440
*VIC:	&=breath they died out . 293390_313440
*VIC:	so, they're no longer there, right ? 293390_313440
*VIC:	&=breath and &=noise hm@fp you had this other idea which continued
	to evolve . 293390_313440
*VIC:	&=breath you can also use uhm@fp Darwin's Theory_of_Evolution for
	the same idea . 293390_313440
*VIC:	&=breath saying you have species A &=breath and they evolve
	throughl time . 293390_313440
*LAU:	&=laugh . 294480_295880
*NIL:	&=laugh . 294530_295030
*NIL:	yeah . 296750_297300
*NIL:	mhm . 307590_308100
*NIL:	mhm . 310820_311540
*NIL:	and [/?] and s@i [/?] so w@i [/-] there will be environmental
	pressures that drive ideas to [/?] t@i [/?] to mutate or to breed
	for certain things . 312590_320180
*VIC:	hm@fp right . 315800_316510
*VIC:	right . 318540_319180
*VIC:	right . 320020_347010
*VIC:	but, hes@fp <most people> [/?] I mean, I think Darwin's theory (.)
	works here, it applies, but most people (.) don't agree . 320020_347010
*VIC:	uhm@fp because it is just like for species and &=breath <you ca@i>
	[/-] like, you have to have a lot more time for Darwin's theory to
	really work . 320020_347010
*VIC:	&=breath but what Foucault is saying is that &=breath hes@fp
	genealogy works . 320020_347010
*VIC:	<that each gener@i> [/-] hes@fp I mean, &=breath in the past, it
	has really been taking hundreds of years for ideas to change, but in
	the past hundred years, it has been every ten years really that
	ideas are changed . 320020_347010
*VIC:	&=breath every generation something different happens, &=breath so
	. 320020_347010
*NIL:	mhm . 325910_326420
*LAU:	so, evoluntionism would be <an a> [/?] kind of a [/?] a
	contradictory theory of the hes@fp evolution of ideas . 346520_352550
*VIC:	<it is> [/?] it is ano@i &=breath &=noise +//. 349080_349950
*VIC:	not so much contradictory . 351120_355360
*VIC:	it works but &=breath &=smack it [/-] only to a point . 351120_355360
*LAU:	oh . 354320_358370
*LAU:	so, but this is one . 354320_358370
*LAU:	<and the> [/?] (.) genealogy is one way of looking at it and
	evolution is another [?] . 354320_358370
*VIC:	right . 357220_373180
*VIC:	genealogy is one way of looking at it, evolution is another way of
	looking at it . 357220_373180
*VIC:	&=breath but I'm saying &=breath for now we'll just look at
	genealogy . 357220_373180
*VIC:	but, &=breath evolution will play a role in a minute . 357220_373180
*VIC:	&=breath all right . 357220_373180
*VIC:	well, you guys know what my whole th@i [/?] (.) thesis is about . 357220_373180
*VIC:	you guys have been helping me out for the past &=breath year and
	half, two years now about it, &=breath so . 357220_373180
*NIL:	yeah . 363120_363410
*NIL:	hm . 370870_371400
*MBE:	just bits and pieces . 372580_374500
*MBE:	not the +//. 372580_374500
*VIC:	so, the reason why I'm doing the research is not so much to
	discover, but uh@fp to answer the question <why &=breath nudity>
	[/?] &=breath why there is a percep@i [/?] (.) difference &=breath
	in perception of the body in Western_Europe and the US, &=breath
	using [/-] in [/?] in [/?] hes@fp within the domain of advertising,
	so . 375030_429160
*VIC:	&=smack &=breath saying that advertising is a reflection of the
	society's uhm@fp (.) perception of the body . 375030_429160
*VIC:	so, in the States, &=breath we don't use nudity in advertising
	except for in very specific areas, &=breath and it is usually geared
	towards specific demographics . 375030_429160
*VIC:	&=breath whereas in Europe, they use it in different areas . 375030_429160
*VIC:	it is more widespread . 375030_429160
*VIC:	&=breath <it is> [/?] (.) there is a higher tolerance in Europe
	than there is here . 375030_429160
*VIC:	&=breath so, &=breath basically this genealogy idea &=breath will
	help us answer the question why there is these two &=breath
	difference in opinions when we started off with the same &=breath
	thinking in Europe and the Europeans came here and we (.) spread . 375030_429160
*VIC:	(.) does everyone buy that ? 375030_429160
*VIC:	&=laugh . 375030_429160
*NIL:	mhm . 422010_422710
*NIL:	sure . 429080_448290
*NIL:	(.) &=breath &=smack I [/?] <I know that> [/?] I know the Germans
	are very into &=breath health fads stuff and Germans invented, well,
	nudism as we know it today . 429080_448290
*NIL:	and uh@fp A@i [/?] Americans &=breath tend to have r@i [/?] r@i
	[/?] religious [/?] (.) hes@fp I [/-] unusual religions coming here

*VIC:	any cr@i +//. 430690_431510
*VIC:	&=smack yeah . 438890_439400
*VIC:	right . 448520_453430
*VIC:	&=breath does anyone else want to (.) add anything at this point ?
	448520_453430
*VIC:	(.) Michael, you look perplexed . 448520_453430
*MBE:	nope . 453560_454010
*VIC:	no ? 454240_454760
*MBE:	it makes sense . 454610_455310
*LAU:	well, it just seems awfully specific . 454850_462570
*LAU:	you know, you're looking you [/?] specifically at Germany, right ?
	454850_462570
*LAU:	Germany and England ? 454850_462570
*LAU:	but all of it ? 454850_462570
*LAU:	oh, okay . 454850_462570
*LAU:	oh, okay . 454850_462570
*VIC:	no, Europe . 458870_459880

*VIC:	uhm@fp <I'll s@i> [/?] I'll show later &=breath <one e@i> [/?]
	hes@fp &=smack &=breath one reason why . 464760_481120
*VIC:	&=breath uhm@fp but basically, the US is s@i [/?] very, very
