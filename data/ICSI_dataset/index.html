    	<h3>Introduction</h3> 

    	<p>ICSI Meeting Transcripts was produced by Linguistic Data
    	Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2004T04 and ISBN 1-58563-286-4.

	<p>The ICSI Meeting corpus is a collection of 75 meetings collected at the
	International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley during the
	years 2000-2002. The meetings included are "natural" meetings in
	the sense that they would have occurred anyway: they are generally
	regular weekly meetings of various ICSI working teams, including the
	team working on the ICSI Meeting Project. In recording meetings of
	this type, we hoped to capture meeting dynamics and speaking styles
	that are as natural as possible given that speakers are wearing
	close-talking microphones and are fully cognizant of the recording
	process. The speech files range in length from 17 to 103
	minutes, but generally run just under an hour each.
	The speech files are available as <a

    	<h3>Data</h3>

    	<p>This corpus consists of 75 word-level transcripts (one transcript file per meeting),
time-synchronized to digitized audio recordings.

	<p>The meetings were recorded with close-talking and far-field
microphones. The transcripts were based mostly on the close-talking
microphones, either separately or blended together in a so-called
"mixed" channel. The focus of the transcripts was on capturing the flow of audible
events, especially the words which were spoken, and who spoke them.

	<p>Transcripts were prepared by means of the 
<a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/Speech/mr/channeltrans.html" style="text-decoration:none">"Channeltrans"</a> interface. Channeltrans is an extension of the "Transcriber" interface.
	
	<p>There are a total of 53 unique speakers in the corpus. Meetings involved anywhere from 3 to 10 participants, averaging 6. The corpus contains a significant proportion of non-native
English speakers, varying in fluency from nearly-native to challenging-to-transcribe.

	<h3>Sponsorship</h3>
	The collection and preparation of this corpus was made possible in   
large part through funding from DARPA, both through the Communicator
project and through a ROAR "seedling", the Swiss IM2 project (National
Centre of Competence in Research, sponsored by the Swiss National
Science Foundation), and a supplementary award from IBM.
