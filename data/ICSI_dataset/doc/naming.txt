Meeting Recorder Naming Conventions

The goal of the naming conventions is to have consistent, short,
and easy to use names for people, microphones, channels, etc. Each
field is fixed length, so sorting and listing is easy. Finally, the
convention is easily extended so that we or others can add data to the
corpus.

Meeting IDs

An individual meeting (also called a session) is labeled with an
alphanumeric tag. For example, "Bmr002". The tag consists of three
fields. The first field must be alphabetic and all uppercase, and
should be one letter. It represents the location of the recording. We
reserve "B" for recordings at ICSI (Berkeley).

The second field must be alphabetic and all lowercase, and should have
two letters. It represents the meeting type. The following tags are
currently assigned:

Tag	Meeting Type
--------------------------------------------------------
db	Database issues meeting
ed	Even Deeper Understanding weekly meeting
mr	Meeting Recorder weekly meeting
ns	Network Services and Applications group meeting
ro	Robustness weekly meeting
sr	SRI collaboration meeting
tr	Meeting Recorder transcriber's meeting
uw	UW collaboration meeting

The final field must be numeric, consisting of three digits (e.g. "004").

Speaker IDs

Speaker tags consist of "m", "f", "u", or "x", for male, female,
unknown, and computer-generated respectively, followed by "e" for
native English speaker or "n" for non-native English speaker, followed
by three numbers. The numbers should be unique across all speakers
(e.g. there is only one person with a speaker ID ending in 003). For
example, "fn002" and "me005" are both legal speaker IDs.

We have developed an XML database (icsi1.spk in the doc
directory) containing speaker information, education level,
language, age, etc. For details on the information we collect,
see the comments in icsi1.spk and the online speaker form:

Mic IDs

A microphone ID represents the type of microphone. It is separate from
the transmission ID, which represents the method by which the signal
gets to the recording equipment. A microphone ID consists of a letter
and a number. The microphone IDs used at ICSI are:

Tag     Description
--------------------------------------------------------------
s1	Sony headset mic ECM-310BMP
s2	Sony handheld mic WRT-807A
c1	Crown headset mic CM 311 A/E
l1	Sony lapel (lavalier) ECM-77BMP
p1	Plantronics monaural headset mic (part number unknown)
a1	Andrea monaural headset mic NC-50
u1	Unknown monaural headset mic
u2	Unknown earplug mic
c2	Crown PZM desktop microphone
u3	Unknown microphone in mockup PDA

Transmission IDs

The transmission ID represents the method by which the microphone is
connected to the recording equipment. It is a letter followed by a
number. The transmission IDs used at ICSI are:

Tag	Description
----------------------------------------
j1	Wired jack (via jimlet through jimbox)
w1	Wireless Sony transmitter/receivers (Sony MB-806A modular
	base, WRU-806A/64 UHF synthesized tuner modules, WRT-805A
	bodypack transmitter) 
w2	Wireless Sony transmitter/receiver integrated into unit
	(e.g. Sony handset with integrated transmitter) 
u1	Unknown wired type (e.g. PZMs)
