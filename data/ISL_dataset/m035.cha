*TAM:	okay . 1070_29660
*TAM:	(.) so, <what I think> [/-] I [/?] I've had the experience of
	having alm@i [/?] done this in sixth grade, and [/?] and [/?] but we
	had the option of using any materials we wanted in creating anything
	.
*TAM:	&=breath <and so> [/?] (.) and so, what I had [?] done [?] was, I
	[/?] I took an egg and I [/?] I slathered it with a nail polish
	hardener to harden the shell, and then I drew pictures on it, <then
	I> [/?] (.) and then I [/?] I like encased it in something .
*TAM:	but, other people had clever things and <they had it padded with>
	[/-] &=breath you know, hes@fp th@i [/?] there was some parameters,
	or something like that, obviously can't do that, but, &=smack
	&=breath I wonder if we could get it inside this balloon .
*CHR:	yeah, I had to do that, too, actually . 9550_11990
*CHR:	xxx +//.
*CHR:	&=laugh xxx +//. 18090_19230
*CEL:	&=laugh . 18730_19580
*CHR:	I was thinking that (.) we need some kind of lubricant . 29450_32590
*DEB:	I was thinking the same thing . 29960_31590
*CEL:	it will break hes@fp if you put it in the balloon, because it will
	go hes@fp <on the> [/?] (.) on the bottom of the balloon . 32980_40820
*CHR:	<how far> [/?] how far does this stretch ? 35030_37240
*DEB:	yeah . 37080_37490
*DEB:	yeah . 40150_41820
*DEB:	yeah, it would .
*CEL:	what if [/?] if we tape it completely, first, if we put tape around
	it (.) to prevent the [/?] hm@fp the shell to break, as you did with
	your polish ? 43120_52390
*TAM:	<or we could always just> [/-] (.) go ah@i +//. 44070_46420
*DEB:	that is a good idea, I think . 52680_54440
*DEB:	no ?
*TAM:	no, I [/?] <I'm thinking ma@i> [/-] well, I mean, that [/?] that is
	possible, maybe we should keep trying these ideas . 53330_80160
*TAM:	ev@i [/?] even if we can't get it in here, &=breath we could always
	hes@fp blow up the balloon .
*TAM:	<I wonder what would happen> [/-] I wonder if this is one of those
	balloons that floats in the air .
*TAM:	(.) you know, if you blow it up and then it stays in the air, and
	then you tie the egg to it and it gradually falls to the ground, <or
	something like> [/-] &=breath or we could always encase it in these
	things, like, you know, &=noise and then tape this together and, you
	know, we could stick the balloon in here as is like padding or +//.

*CHR:	I think that might work . 82230_83280
*CEL:	mhm . 83480_83760
*TAM:	but, now, let us see, what can we do with a paper+clip ? 83990_86090
*CEL:	we don't have to use it . 88790_89980
*CHR:	poke the hole in the top of the cup to get the string through ? 89620_92940
*TAM:	see uhm@fp maybe [?] we [?] +//. 93010_93910
*CEL:	maybe, yeah, if (.) you put the balloon on the bottom (.) as an
	airbag . 93660_119550
*CEL:	&=breath the egg, this, and (.) then we want this to fall like
	this, (.) in this side <to the> [/?] for [/?] for the egg to be over

*CEL:	(.) maybe we can use <the hair+clip> [/?] the [/?] the clip to put
	here .
*CEL:	&=breath and then, this, to drop it like this, maybe it will stay .
*TAM:	hm . 111240_111590
*TAM:	wouldn't [?] it [?] be interesting . 119060_145900
*TAM:	well, what would happen if we did something like that ?
*TAM:	if we poked a hole in here, &=smack &=breath and we had our string
	dangling down through here, &=breath and then it was tied through
	the hole after we blew up the balloon &=breath to this thing, so, it
	was in there, and then we [/?] &=breath we, like, tie this, like,
	sort of around the egg, and then we [/?] we tape the string to the

	the egg isn't actually touching anything .
*TAM:	(.) and if it falls, <it is not> [/?] it is just kind of like in

*CHR:	yeah, but the thing is, you don't know how [/?] if the egg is gonna
	hit against this . 145500_156540
*CHR:	<like you can't really guarantee> [/-] like even if the weight is

*TAM:	mhm . 152690_153120
*CEL:	oh . 158630_159500
*TAM:	yeah, I'm wondering if there is some way that we could stick tape
