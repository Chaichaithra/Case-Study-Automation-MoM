*COU:	that is crap . 117500_118700
*FDH:	what is crap about it ? 118960_120280
*COU:	&=laugh the fact that they wouldn't do that, that just seems like

	white males . 119660_133830
*COU:	&=laugh am I making enough sweeping generalities yet ? 119660_133830

*FDH:	yeah, if you could make the decision, would you publish that ad ? 144960_147080
*MHJ:	I guess it depends on who reads the magazine and what [/-] where I
	am . 147250_150370
*FDH:	well, a Sports_Illustrated magazine . 150480_152140

*FDH:	in the US . 154730_159110
*FDH:	(.) but keep in mind that you also publish the swimsuit issue every

*MHJ:	I don't know, I guess it is a political decision . 159020_163880
*MHJ:	I mean, I [/-] then uh@fp if I publish it, then I would take a lot
	of heat for it, because people would complain, probably . 159020_163880
*COU:	uh@fp I think it is in better taste than the swimsuit issue,
	because it is clearly &=breath like a joke . 164600_170970
*COU:	and <it is> [/?] it is kind of poking fun at it . 164600_170970
*FDH:	and so it is funny . 171260_173340
*FDH:	but do you think everyone would +//. 171260_173340

*FDH:	do you think everyone would find it funny, all the readers ? 175290_180150
*FDH:	or do you think readers would complain ? 175290_180150
*COU:	I think you could find worse stuff in like Newsweek . 182000_188090
*COU:	I don't think if they complain they would ver@i [/?] have a very

*FDH:	&=smack okay . 193200_211090
*FDH:	&=swallow uhm@fp what I find interesting about this is that this is
	one of the only ads I could find that had male nudity in it . 193200_211090
*FDH:	&=breath and I have looked &=breath hes@fp through at least, I
	would say, a hundred magazines from the US, England, Germany,
	&=breath and France . 193200_211090
*MHJ:	what kind of magazines ? 210030_211060
*FDH:	men's magazines, women's magazines, uh@fp (.) news magazines . 211630_216840
*COU:	huh . 218200_221070

*COU:	&=laugh I can't think of any ads . 218200_221070
*FDH:	I mean, even like National_Geographic magazines . 219100_221590
*MHJ:	hm . 221460_221920
*FDH:	I [/-] this is one, I found three . 222270_224570
*MHJ:	hm . 225010_225490
*FDH:	one has just a guy with a vest on, no shirt . 225880_309510
*FDH:	it is the best I could find . 225880_309510
*FDH:	&=breath the other one was uhm@fp &=smack actually a Kahlua ad of a
	&=breath very very very but [/?] hm@fp uh@fp muscular man, &=breath
	with <a (.) thing on his head> [/?] hes@fp a mask on his head,
	&=breath and just wearing a [/?] a G_string . 225880_309510
*FDH:	&=laugh &=breath <that wa@i> [/?] that was the most nudity I could
	find besides this ad . 225880_309510
*FDH:	but this ad was never published . 225880_309510
*FDH:	&=breath uhm@fp what I find interesting about it, and I open this
	up to you guys, &=breath is that there was another study done by an
	organization, I think <it is e@i> [/?] (.) Eur@i [/?] it is a
	European organization, I think it is (.) Swiss, &=breath uhm@fp (.)
	&=smack that did (.) a survey on [/?] I think it was online, <but
	they did> [/-] &=breath they collected data in countries all around
	the world . 225880_309510
*FDH:	&=smack &=breath and they wanted to know things about paintings . 225880_309510
*FDH:	&=breath and what people liked about paintings and artwork . 225880_309510
*FDH:	&=breath and one of the things that they found out is that &=breath
	throughout the world, &=breath people prefer nude &=breath well, not
	nude, but &=breath women and children hes@fp significantly over men
	in paintings . 225880_309510
*FDH:	&=breath men or, like, you know, when you see the percentage signs
	[?], <I don't have> [/?] &=breath I haven't downloaded those graphs
	. 225880_309510
*FDH:	&=breath uhm@fp &=swallow it is like two, three percent of these
	populations of these countries, &=breath if it was even that much,
	said that they would prefer men over women and children, whereas
	children was &=breath upwards of fifty percent and women were
	somewhere between thirty and sixty percent . 225880_309510
*FDH:	&=breath and this was in hes@fp US, European countries, &=breath
	even into China &=breath uhm@fp it was the same . 225880_309510
*MHJ:	oh . 243530_245070
*MHJ:	&=throat . 243530_245070
*COU:	hm . 284740_285330
*MHJ:	hm . 307890_308380
*COU:	wow . 309980_310610
*FDH:	&=smack so, (.) let me ask you guys, would you guys &=breath I
	mean, <do you g@i> [/-] in artwork, thinking about artwork, would
	you prefer to see &=breath a woman, children or men ? 310050_317840
*COU:	I think we see more women anyway, so that would sort of lead me to
	&=breath (.) think oh, I [?] prefer women, just because <it is> [/?]
	it is what you see the most of anyway . 318770_328850
*COU:	th@i [/-] it is kind of con@i [/?] const@i [/?] uh@fp consistent .
	318770_328850
*MHJ:	yeah, that is true . 325740_326710
*FDH:	why do you think that is, that (.) we primarily only see women and
	not men ? 329420_333590
*COU:	because +//. 331020_331490
*COU:	they're curvier and they're easier to paint . 333440_336810
*COU:	&=laugh no . 333440_336810
*MHJ:	<and that> [/-] (.) yeah, and they were like &=noise +//. 335350_337230
*COU:	'cause <it is> [/?] it is more <of a> [/?] of a shocking . 338060_343140
*COU:	w@i [/-] it is hes@fp +//. 338060_343140
*MHJ:	uh@fp a [/?] a painter is not going to paint a man, like, oh, look

*MHJ:	(.) I mean +//. 343080_347110
*COU:	well, <you s@i> [/?] you see the sculpture of David . 346260_349860
*COU:	(.) that is definitely +//. 346260_349860
*FDH:	why not ? 347010_347810
*MHJ:	because it is just +//. 348120_349270
*FDH:	well . 348160_355540
*FDH:	yeah, David, that is exactly what I just thought of . 348160_355540
*FDH:	what about all the [/?] the ancient Greek and Roman statues, the

*MHJ:	<what about> [/-] okay . 356440_358540
*MHJ:	but uhm@fp +//. 356440_358540
*FDH:	why did that change ? 358200_359360
*COU:	I think it is more of, like, uh@fp it is not [/?] not [/?] not
	scandalous, that is not the word at all, but it is less &=breath
	like &=breath women need to hes@fp uh@fp what is the word I'm
	looking for . 360400_396890
*COU:	(.) keep a certain amount of (.) coverage on themselves &=laugh
	that men don't really have . 360400_396890
*COU:	you could walk around without a shirt if you're a guy, but for
	women you can't, just because of the shape of your body, like just
	&=breath biology, I suppose . 360400_396890
*COU:	so, if hes@fp societies have &=breath deemed certain things (.)
	appropriate and certain things not, then the less appropriate things

	they're gonna be &=breath you know . 360400_396890
*COU:	(.) m@i [/?] more thought provoking, I suppose, yeah . 360400_396890
*FDH:	&=smack more artsy . 394400_395560
*FDH:	well, what about uhm@fp other cultures, especially in desert areas
	and the tropical areas, where everyone walks around naked . 396960_445900
*FDH:	(.) what kind of artwork do you think you would see there ? 396960_445900
*FDH:	(.) or, think about primitive cultures, where they had &=breath
	uhm@fp their artwork primarily consisted of gods and goddesses, and,
	I mean, I [/-] sure you guys have seen the artwork of uh@fp (.)
	prehistoric men, where &=breath the women were very large and robust
	. 396960_445900
*FDH:	&=breath do you think that would have something to do with it ? 396960_445900
*FDH:	that the reason why, <we see> [/?] well, we can't see naked men but
	we see naked women is because [/?] &=breath 'cause something in our
	society which is not necessarily just part of our humanity, but
	something social ? 396960_445900
*FDH:	(.) 'cause if it is not something even biological . 396960_445900

*FDH:	that somehow it developed socially . 447530_449780
*COU:	hm . 452830_453360
*MHJ:	what are you asking ? 453650_454610
*FDH:	yes ? 453710_454280
*FDH:	do you agree with that, that it is something socially, or it is
	really something biological . 454930_458280
*MHJ:	hm . 455170_455520
*COU:	is it, like, a universal thing . 457790_460850
*COU:	<or is it> [/-] &=breath oh . 457790_460850
*FDH:	is it something you would find everywhere, as in, it is biological,

*MHJ:	is that what +//. 469790_474300
*FDH:	well, the fact that we see more naked women than we do men . 474750_486260
*FDH:	I mean, I have found countless countless countless advertisements
	&=breath both directed towards men and women with naked women in it
	. 474750_486260
*FDH:	but not naked men . 474750_486260

*MHJ:	no . 496780_502710
*FDH:	but not men . 501510_502360

*FDH:	would [/-] do you guys have any opinions as to why we find naked

*COU:	uhm@fp (.) &=breath this is kind of a s@i [/-] well &=breath I
	don't know . 523190_546650
*COU:	&=breath <I think i@i> [/-] like (.) men can run around wearing

*COU:	&=breath but, you know . 523190_546650

*FDH:	&=breath uhm@fp &=breath there has been research done where

*FDH:	<you ha@i> [/-] you're more likely to remember a man's face if it

*FDH:	&=breath and if you're talking about advertising, you wanna use
	attractive people, right ? 547280_594690
*FDH:	not necessarily ugly people . 547280_594690
*FDH:	&=breath so, you're not necessarily gonna remember a uh@fp (.)
