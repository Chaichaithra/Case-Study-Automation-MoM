<!ELEMENT Meeting  (Preamble,Transcript)>
<!ATTLIST Meeting  Session CDATA #REQUIRED
                   DateTimeStamp CDATA #REQUIRED
                   Version CDATA #IMPLIED
                   VersionDate CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
Example: 

<Meeting Session="Bmr012" DateTimeStamp="2001-02-01-1500" Version="1" VersionDate="Dec 11 2002">

The Session tag specifies the location (B for the ICSI meeting room
in Berkeley), the meeting type (mr for meeting recorder meeting),
and a unique 3 digit number. For a complete description of naming
conventions, please see naming.txt or naming.html in the doc
directory.

The DateTimeStamp is the start time and date of the meeting. The
format is yyyy-mm-dd-hhmm, where hh is a 24 hour time.

The Version and VersionDate indicate the version of the transcript.

<!ELEMENT Preamble (Notes|Participants|Channels)*>

<!-- 
The Preamble contains meta data about the participants, the channels,
and free-form notes about the meeting.
-->

<!ELEMENT Notes    (#PCDATA)>

<!--

The Notes contain free-form notes. Often, it will contain information
about problems with the meeting (e.g. dead batteries), participant
information (e.g. mn017 left early), and tasks in the meeting (e.g.
simultaneous digits).

The names of participants have been replaced with their speaker IDs in
the Notes section.

-->

<!ELEMENT Participants (Participant)*>
<!ATTLIST Participants DB CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--

Information about the Participants of the meeting. By "Participant",
we simply mean any person who spoke during the meeting. The DB tag
indicates the speaker database in which is stored more information
about the participants. -->

<!ELEMENT Participant EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST Participant  Name ID  #REQUIRED
                       Channel IDREF #IMPLIED
                       Seat CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
Examples:

      <Participant Name="me018" Channel="chan0" Seat="9"/>
      <Participant Name="mn005" Channel="chanB"/>
      <Participant Name="mn014"/>

The Name is the unique user tag. See naming.txt or naming.html in the
doc directory for details on the naming convention, and the speaker
database (icsi1.spk) for additional information about each speaker.

The Channel is a unique tag indicating the primary near-field channel
on which the participant can be heard (see below). If the participant
did not use a near-field microphone, then the Channel tag will be
absent.

The Seat indicates in which seat the participant started the
meeting. The seats are numbered clockwise starting at the door (see
seatingchart.txt in the doc directory). We only began recording seat
location about half way through the collection process, so many
meetings do not have Seat tags.

<!ELEMENT Channels (Channel)*>

<!--
Example:

      <Channel Name="chan0" Mic="c1" Transmission="w1" Gain="9" AudioFile="chan0.sph"/>
      <Channel Name="chanE" Mic="c2" Transmission="u1" Gain="9" AudioFile="chanE.sph"/>

The Channel contains information about the microphones. The Name is
a unique identifier for the channel. The Mic is an identifier for
the type of microphone (e.g. c1 is a Crown Headset Microphone, c2
is a Crown PZM desktop microphone). Transmission indicates how the
microphone is connected to the recording system (e.g. w1 is a wireless
Sony system, j1 is a wired jack). See naming.txt or naming.html for
details.

The Gain is a software recording level setting. Note that some early
meetings did not indicate the gain setting. In these cases, a default
gain (which is probably incorrect) is listed in this tag, and mention
is made in the Notes section.

Finally, the AudioFile contains the file name in which the data
is stored. For the ICSI meeting corpus, the files are in NIST
Sphere/audio format and have been compressed with the "shorten"
program.

<!-- Example:

    <Segment StartTime="331.150" EndTime="332.339" Participant="me011">
      On <Emphasis> which </Emphasis> tool?
    </Segment>

Each Segment must identify a start time and an end time measured in
seconds from the start of the audio file. If the segment represents
sounds from a particular participant (e.g. speech), then the Segment
must include a Participant attribute. The value of the Participant
attribute must match the Name attribute from the Participant tag
(see above). The Channel defaults to the Channel specified in the
Participant tag. In unusual cases, the Channel may specify a channel
different from the default channel (e.g. a participant temporarily
uses another participant's microphone).

If the participant spoke into a near-field microphone, then the
CloseMic attribute will be true (the default). Otherwise, the CloseMic
attribute will be false.

During most meetings, we ask the participants to read a set of
connected digits. The DigitTask attribute should be true during these
segments.

Note on acronyms: We did not include a separate acronym tag. Instead,
if the acronym is pronounced as a word, then the acronym is listed
with no special notation. For example, NASA will simply appear as
"NASA".

If the letters of the acronym are spoken, such as with "IBM", this
is denoted by underscores in the transcription. For example, "IBM"
appears in the corpus as "I_B_M".

Mixed cases also appear. For example, "x ray" is transcribed "X_ray".

See the section on <Emphasis> below for important information on
acronyms with emphasis.

Example:

Parts of a segment that are spoken in a language other than English
are identified with the Foreign tag. The attribute Language is
required, and must be the two letter international language symbol for
the language being used.

de - German
it - Italian
no - Norwegian
fr - French
es - Spanish
la - Latin

The Description attribute is optional, but frequently contains the
translation.

<!--

When a syllable in a word is emphasized, the word may be marked with
the Emphasis tag.

When Emphasis is used within an acronym, the coding is a combination
of underscores and the Emphasis tags. For example, "I_<Emphasis> B </Emphasis>_M" 
indicates that the B is emphasized.

When the emphasis tag is in the leading position, it indicates that at
least one of the syllables is emphasized, but does not indicate which
syllable. For example:

I_<Emphasis> B </Emphasis>_M		The B is emphasized
<Emphasis> I_B_M </Emphasis>		Any of the syllables may be emphasized

and <Pronounce> partially  </Pronounce>

When an obviously non-canonical pronunciation is used, it may be
marked with the Pronounce tag. The Pronunciation attribute, if
included, indicates how the word or phrase was actually pronounced,
either by specifying the pronunciation (as in the first example)
or by describing its properties (as in the second example). The
contained text shows the canonical pronunciation. If the Pronunciation
attribute is missing, it indicates that the word was pronounced in a
non-canonical way.

In cases where the transcriber was uncertain of the transcript, the
Uncertain tag may be used. The contained text is the transcriber's
best guess, or may be the special symbol @@ to mean unintelligible.
If the NumSyllables attribute is given, it is the transcriber's best
guess at the number of syllables in the Uncertain section.
