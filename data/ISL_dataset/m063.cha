*CYA:	right . 63900_68090
*CYA:	&=breath and I sent a fax to the Physics_Stockroom, so we should

*FDH:	hey . 67350_71060
*FDH:	xxx oh, could I have one ? 67350_71060

*SAQ:	okay, yeah . 74130_75090
*SAQ:	no problem . 74130_75090
*SAQ:	uh@fp we [/?] we talked to [/?] uh@fp to [/?] to xxx down in the

*FDH:	does he want more than one ? 75840_77740
*FDH:	or just [?] +//. 75840_77740
*FDH:	yeah . 78210_78640
*FDH:	xxx (.) I just had one . 79620_81510

*CYA:	oh, okay . 79800_80270
*SAQ:	uhm@fp you know, <and we got our rec@i> [/-] he set up our [?] [/?]
	our [?] accounts for us . 80490_83270
*CYA:	okay, terrific . 83420_84280
*SAQ:	<and he said that> [/-] uhm@fp &=swallow you know, we talked about
	the elastic+polymers and stuff that they could possibly do . 83760_94820
*SAQ:	&=swallow we're gonna start using &=breath uhm@fp Solidworks . 83760_94820
*SAQ:	&=swallow use it as a tutorial . 83760_94820
*SAQ:	i@i [/?] <it sh@i> [/?] it shouldn't be too hard . 83760_94820
*CYA:	okay, great . 94890_95570
*SAQ:	like, I [/?] I've used Autocad . 95060_98910
*SAQ:	I [?] pro@i [/?] programmed [?] at four and [?] xxx &=breath
	&=noise +//. 95060_98910
*HHI:	and [/?] and [/?] and plus [/?] &=breath plus xxx would [?] help
	you a lot . 95910_99380
*SAQ:	I think the first thing we're gonna design will be the [/?] uhm@fp
	the battery casing . 100100_108350
*SAQ:	I think that is <made [?] a li@i> [/?] a little easier thing to do
	. 100100_108350
*SAQ:	'cause it is pretty much just a [/?] &=breath like a bullet shaped
	cy@i [/?] cylinder . 100100_108350
*CYA:	right . 108840_109380
*CYA:	&=laugh . 108840_109380
*SAQ:	<with a> [/?] you know [?], like a hole in the bottom, hole in the
	top, hm@fp for the wires to feed through . 109270_122000
*SAQ:	&=breath and, like, s@i [/?] you know, slots in the middle, so that
	you can kind of &=breath you know, f@i [/?] feed the battery through
	it, (.) <and it still> [/-] do you know what I mean ? 109270_122000
*SAQ:	like, if it was solid, you couldn't get the battery in it, so . 109270_122000
*HHI:	mhm . 111320_111950
*HHI:	mhm . 121120_121490
*CYA:	right . 121440_124730
*CYA:	so, it is like a kind of a pocket that you're pushing it in . 121440_124730
*CYA:	(.) yeah . 121440_124730
*SAQ:	yeah, it is like slip the thing in the pocket . 122860_132060
*SAQ:	<and forget> [/-] <they would be like s@i> [/-] you can like
	springs in here to &=breath keep the contact with the positive and
	negative . 122860_132060
*SAQ:	&=breath so, if [?] [/-] it'll be a pretty easy design to do, <and
	a> [/?] and a good first start . 122860_132060
*HHI:	yeah . 131060_137880
*HHI:	(.) you could even look at some that has already been done . 131060_137880
*HHI:	(.) xxx you know, there is battery (.) holders and casings . 131060_137880
*SAQ:	yeah th@i +//. 137800_138460
*HHI:	the xxx devices, yeah . 138330_139530
*CYA:	hm@fp right . 139150_139690
*SAQ:	I'm sure there is something we could find . 139590_140960
*CYA:	ha@i [/?] have you thought any more about the parallel versus
	series recharging ? 140460_144070
*SAQ:	uhm@fp . 144330_145150
*AOF:	hm . 145010_145670
*CYA:	&=smack I guess it won't matter . 146780_148890
*CYA:	you'll have the same battery casing . 146780_148890
*AOF:	you just reminded me of that, actually . 147480_152960
*AOF:	(.) I have some stuff drawn up and I didn't even remember that . 147480_152960
*CYA:	okay . 149290_149800
*CYA:	hm@fp okay . 153000_153720
*SAQ:	yeah, <that may be something w@i> [/-] hes@fp maybe [?] if [?] we
	[?] have [?] problems we talk to xxx about . 154210_157280
*AOF:	pen me . 156740_157230
*SAQ:	get your own pen, (.) Jesus . 158160_159970
*AOF:	I don't have a pen . 158790_160520
*AOF:	my bag is over there . 158790_160520
*SAQ:	all right . 160810_171790
*SAQ:	uhm@fp (.) uhm@fp and hes@fp the couple times we tried calling
	Lynn_Tailoring the main woman wasn't in . 160810_171790
*SAQ:	so, I [/?] I can give her until the end of the week . 160810_171790
*SAQ:	and if I can't get a hold of her, I'll (.) try someone else . 160810_171790
*SAQ:	<to see> [/-] even a little closer . 160810_171790
*CYA:	okay . 167680_168200
*CYA:	just go to someplace else, okay . 169290_171280
*CYA:	sounds good . 172330_173060
*SAQ:	the only [/?] only reason why we went there to begin with 'cause
	that is what th@i [/?] the ladies from Gloria_Horn &=breath and th@i
	[/?] th@i +//. 172390_177560
*CYA:	right . 176940_178930
*CYA:	and they've been so helpful before . 176940_178930
*CYA:	yeah . 176940_178930
*SAQ:	yeah, they've been helpful . 177830_182880
*SAQ:	and they seem pretty cool, so, try to help them out a little bit .
	177830_182880
*SAQ:	but if they can't, then (.) we tried . 177830_182880
*FDH:	yeah . 178300_178930
*CYA:	okay . 182990_185310
*CYA:	&=breath try to, then, this week . 182990_185310
*SAQ:	yeah . 185160_189240
*SAQ:	so, you know, I'll give them 'till Friday . 185160_189240
*SAQ:	&=breath &=noise &=smack &=throat . 185160_189240
*CYA:	okay, sounds good . 187290_188240
*CYA:	what else do you think you wanna design using the elastic+polymers
	? 191300_194170
*CYA:	&=breath . 191300_194170
*SAQ:	uhm@fp I guess that would be it . 194210_202860
*SAQ:	th@i [/?] the other thing I want to use the lab for was the casing
	of the control unit depending (.) on how big it is gonna be . 194210_202860
*CYA:	right . 198600_199120
*CYA:	&=smack that makes perfect sense . 200830_202010
*HHI:	and you can just use the Abs_plastic for that . 202460_204610
*SAQ:	yeah . 204670_210620
*SAQ:	(.) 'cause it [/?] it'll be thin, and it [/?] i@i [/?] it could be
	hard, and that is not gonna be too uncomfortable or anything . 204670_210620
*SAQ:	(.) &=breath &=noise . 204670_210620
*HHI:	yeah . 205110_205560
*CYA:	okay . 210140_211070
*SAQ:	&=breath hm@fp . 212090_212680
*CYA:	great . 213440_220930
*CYA:	&=breath well, that covers uh@fp two of the things that we were
	supposed to [/?] &=breath to hit this week . 213440_220930
*CYA:	&=breath we also have the uh@fp marketing plan . 213440_220930
*FDH:	I have a marketing outline (.) to hand out . 220860_230450
*FDH:	(.) &=smack it is very general . 220860_230450
*FDH:	<it just> [/-] uhm@fp &=smack basically what the survey would [?]
	be like and how many people we may need . 220860_230450
*FDH:	and +//. 220860_230450
*CYA:	okay, great . 222520_223090
*CYA:	okay, sounds great . 230580_231470
*SAQ:	&=breath &=noise . 231670_232450
*CYA:	look this over . 232700_233440
*HHI:	one thing I was thinking is it would be a good thing to take with
	you (.) to Reno . 232870_246080
*HHI:	<if you could get> [/-] (.) I don't know . 232870_246080
*HHI:	xxx something for us to shoot for, I don't know how you guys feel .
	232870_246080
*HHI:	&=breath I think it would be real good to have something, you know,
	(.) a [?] tangible [?] prototype, for the [/?] the trip on the
	eleventh and twelfth [?] . 232870_246080
*SAQ:	a tangible prototype ? 242930_243860
*SAQ:	definitely . 244630_245140
*CYA:	right . 246530_249090
*CYA:	which is just [?] about a month from now . 246530_249090
*CYA:	yeah . 246530_249090
*HHI:	a month [/?] month from now . 248070_251110
*HHI:	(.) a month from today . 248070_251110
*FDH:	so basically, I thought we would uhm@fp test the prototype by
	asking people to actually use the jacket in, like, everyday &=breath
	usage, for, like, one to two day period, &=breath <and it would be
	about> [/?] like, maybe, I was hoping for maybe twenty people, over
	six weeks . 252670_264420
*CYA:	okay . 260600_261180
*SAQ:	&=breath &=noise . 264050_264440
*CYA:	okay . 264520_265030
*FDH:	<and ask> [/-] just have them fill out a survey afterwards, and
	then also do a personal interview with them . 264710_273080
*FDH:	so, &=breath I may actually sit there and maybe prompt questions,
	or just try to get some feedback from them . 264710_273080
*CYA:	okay . 273190_276530
*CYA:	the Likert_Scale . 273190_276530
*CYA:	is that a way, like, bring [?] evaluation on ? 273190_276530
*FDH:	yeah, Likert_Scale is like a one to five scale . 275330_277710
*CYA:	okay . 277680_278260
*FDH:	and uh@fp we just ask some close+ended questions that ask them to
	rate certain things . 278050_301140
*FDH:	but I'm not really sure right now what sort of things to rate . 278050_301140
*FDH:	I don't think we really know that until we have a prototype and we
	know exactly what we want to know &=breath from them . 278050_301140
*FDH:	know a little bit more specific . 278050_301140
*FDH:	&=breath and then, for the verbatim questions, I found that
	verbatim questions are great for getting &=breath all sorts of
	things that you would never think of . 278050_301140
*FDH:	&=breath and just ask them some open+ended resp@i [/?] uh@fp
	response questions . 278050_301140
*FDH:	just maybe two or three of them . 278050_301140
*CYA:	okay . 290240_290800
*SAQ:	verbatim questions are like [/?] just like +//. 301100_302700
*CYA:	that sounds good . 301560_302160
*FDH:	what do you think about this ? 302990_305820
*FDH:	and then they can say whatever they wanna say . 302990_305820
*SAQ:	what do you think about this, okay . 303480_304680
*CYA:	&=smack right . 305780_308720
*CYA:	and they might pinpoint things you haven't thought of . 305780_308720
*CYA:	yeah . 305780_308720
*FDH:	yeah . 307830_308390
*HHI:	would you record those ? 308210_309210
*FDH:	hm ? 309630_310040
*HHI:	would you record those ? 310050_311020
*FDH:	they'll be rewriting them down on the survey, so . 311370_318590
*FDH:	&=breath and then, as far as, like, the personal interviews, I can
	ta@i [/?] either take [?] notes, or I can actually record them . 311370_318590
*HHI:	okay . 313220_313730
*HHI:	that is what I mean . 318000_319990
*HHI:	that is what I was talking about, personal interviews . 318000_319990
*FDH:	yeah, the personal interviews, <I can> [/?] I can record them, like
	uh@fp actually (.) uh@fp use, like a [/?] &=breath <a audio> [/?]
	xxx a cassette or something . 319960_327030
*CYA:	okay, that sounds great . 326860_327800
*HHI:	if [?] [/-] you can get good [/?] great quotes that way if you xxx
	material . 328210_332200
*FDH:	&=laugh . 329730_331010
*CYA:	right . 330550_336230
*CYA:	&=laugh &=breath that is true . 330550_336230
*CYA:	(.) &=breath when they gush all over the jacket and say how much

*SAQ:	hm@fp yeah . 335450_335990
*CYA:	if it keeps getting cold, like they're predicting for this weekend,

*FDH:	yeah . 342550_351000
*FDH:	<I thought> [/?] hes@fp I mean, assuming the prototype would

	and then <a little> [/?] a couple weeks in October, we could do it .
	342550_351000
*FDH:	so people actually have an opportunity to use it . 342550_351000
*CYA:	okay, great . 350960_351580
*SAQ:	yeah . 351030_358080

*SAQ:	that [/-] hes@fp hm@fp I think we use a standard one . 572420_582230
